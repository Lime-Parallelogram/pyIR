# IR-Code-Decoder--
This is a simple GUI program written in python to obtain the IR information from a remote and output it in HEX format.
Please note: at the moment, this only works with NEC protocol remotes so if it does not work, please try a different remote.

This software must be run on a Raspberry Pi.
